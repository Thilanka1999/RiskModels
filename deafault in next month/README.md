# Credit-Risk-Modeling-using-Machine/Deep-Learning
Captstone Project by Nishant Sharma

This is a comprehensive comparison of risk prediction models. 


Here is what you need to see with respect to the steps followed->

1.Data analysis and visualization can be found in Xploratory_analysis.ipynb


2.Preprocessing and Feed Forward Deep Neural network training and scores can be found in deep_default.ipynb

3.Preprocessing,ensemble methods training and model evaluations can be found in Preprocessing_modeling_refinements_evaluations.ipynb


Results-
Finally,Gradient Boosting with tuned parameters was selected with optimal training/testing scores accross 10 folds of data.
